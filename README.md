# Automatic Tuner with Motorise String Winder
This project uses the combination of electronics, programming and music theory to create an automatic system for tuning stringed instruments. This is needed as instruments need tuning and re-stringing very regularly so a system that could save all the hassle could fit a niche in the large music industry market. 
A combination of FFT and Zero-crossing is used to detect a frequency and then a motor is turned forward or backward dependant if the frequency is above or below a chosen note. The goal was for a general system that works across many different instruments so both microphone and Jack input were set up to be accepted as inputs. The testing of the system was done using an electro-acoustic guitar as this has both input types and is an instrument that is widely used, as well as an electric bass to test the system on high tension strings. 
The final product of this project was a working prototype that could accurately tune to 1.36% precision. 
Work is needed in refining the system with noise removal on microphone input so that instrument without a Jack input could be used. Also, adaptions to the design make the casing smaller need to be made before the system would be suitable for open market.
